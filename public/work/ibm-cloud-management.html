    <p>IBM's current monitoring solution was criminal. The design was not intuitive and would also leave users lost in a
      series of menus. </p>
    <p>We tackled the problem by first understanding all the facets of a cloud/on-premise application, and how these
      variables might affect an application's performance.</p>
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>After we came to an understanding of all the hidden variables we created a robust data structure for presenting
      all of the variables in an "glance-able" way. The goal was to give a DevOps professional a dashboard where they
      would be able to diagnose performance issues quickly, and perhaps even catch them before they occur. This meant
      giving the entire environments highly "suspect" metrics to the user in a concise and consumable data drive graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      This product took a look at infrastructure from the bare metal up. Rather than looking at monitoring from an
      application level, we designed a system for understanding the entire scope of your application infrastructure in
      the cloud. These tools, coupled with the insights from <a href="./bam.html">BAM</a>, would give you a robust set
      of tools for application and infrastructure monitoring in a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment.
    </p>
    <p>The entire application also provided robust tools for fixing and alerting the appropriate parties that something
      has gone wrong. </p>
