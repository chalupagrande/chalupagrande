    <h1>The Smart Patient Academy - Patient Identity Profile</h1>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Doctors do not have reliable metrics for understanding how a patients mental health might impact their
          treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>A survey for both patients and care givers to determine what sort of user/provider they are.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Designer, Full-stack Developer</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>There is a lot that goes into healthcare; not the least of which is the patients attitude towards their own care.
      A lot negative outcomes can be avoided if there is a more clear understanding of how the healthcare process works,
      with regards to <i>both</i> the healthcare provider and the patient.</p>
    <p>In order to solve this gap in understanding, Smart Patient Academy aims to increase the level of engagment from
      all parties involved, and provide a tangible metric for how engaged you might be. This score would help both
      parties reflect on how they might improve their healthcare experience. Through the Smart Patient Academy book, you
      learn multiple examples of how the system is not neccessarily designed to benefit patients. You also learn what to
      do about it. That, in conjunction with the Smart Patient Academy Patient Identity Profile will help you move
      through the steps to become a more empowered patient.</p>
