    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Developers enjoy coding. Testing and monitoring their apps is tedious and boring and often left too late in the
      lifecycle. Further, existing IBM monitoring tools had a steep learning curve and focused on data-dumping and
      letting users figure things out.</p>
    <p>Focusing on synthetic monitoring, the simulation of end-users going through an interface, we built a cloud
      service that allowed users to test their apps, web pages and APIs from different geolocations with no setup.</p>
    <p>Throughout the research process it became clear that users wanted a quick overview of existing problems while
      pointing them in the right direction. Our goal was to answer the question: is there anything wrong and what do I
      need to do about it? Hence, we established a clear hierarchy to provide crucial data at first glance and more
      information at the users request.</p>
    <p>Our design was a hierarchical concept, inspired by TV’s picture-in-picture concept (if you’re old enough) allowed
      users to compare the performance across metrics while maintaining focus on primary data. Below, a view of all
      application tests and downtime metrics.</p>
