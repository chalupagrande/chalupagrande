      After multiple explorations and testing sessions we settled on letting users build their own journey, based on
      their expertise and goals. Providing different learning modules with clear expectations we empowered users to
      integrate data and enrich their apps, no install required.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focused on a fictional "unicorn" persona. Our persona would know everything, front to back, about migrating
      from a monolithic on-premise infrastructure, to a distributed, data drive cloud experience.
      By focusing on this mythical persona, we were able to identify the 5 main areas of expertise this person would
      have, or in the case of a real developer, would want done for them in an easy to learn and efficient way. Those 5
      steps were: <strong>Modernize </strong>,<strong>Collect</strong>, <strong>Organize</strong>, <strong>Analyze &amp;
        Build</strong> and <strong>Integrate &amp; Deploy</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>After identifying these 5 areas, we were able to provide contextual information and mock data for a user to walk
      through the entire end to end experience of bringing their large enterprise app into the modern world.</p>
