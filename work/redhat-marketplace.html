        <p>A modern software marketplace targeting customers already using RedHats ecosystem. The software would be

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      With IBM's acquisition of Redhat, there was tremendous pressure to design and implement a competitive modern
      software marketplace for Redhat's Enterprise Linux (or RHEL). RHEL had become the defacto enterprise linux
      distro because it was well supported and had a thriving community. With growing competition from AWS
      Marketplace and Bitnami, the model for software distribution had changed. Developers and DevOps engineers
      wanted a way to download the software directly into their software stack using Docker containers (or in the
      case of RHEL -- operators). This makes things like prototyping software integrations faster and more reliable.
      With the merger with Redhat, IBM had a strategic position to capitalize of ubiquity of RHEL in the enterprise
      software space.

      My role was to design prototypes and micro-interactions. It is immensely important to develop a sense of trust
      with any user, especially when they are poised to buy really expensive software on behalf of their entire company.
      Simple things like micro-interactions and animations have the ability to elevate a product's design, and instill
      this sense of trust, that we, as the seller of these products, cares about quality.
