    <h4>Why chalupagrande?</h4>
    <p>My dad has an incredible wit. Just about everytime I talk to him he has a different nickname for me. The one I
      like the most is Chalupa Grande.</p>

    <h4>Why does this site look so dumb if you're so good at all this stuff?</h4>
    <p>Why spend more time on self promotion than necessary? Plus. I can spend more time on your project! And also other
      more fun things. </p>

    <h4>What web technologies are you familiar with?</h4>
    <p>javascript, html5, css3, babel, webpack, gulp, react, redux, carbon components, vue, nextjs, git, mongoDB, neo4j,
      cypher, stripe, twilio, apollo, grapql, tensorflowjs,
      lerna, node, express, mongoose, eslint, prettier, jest, threejs, passport, antd design system, scss, yarn, docker,
      kubernetes, d3, p5 <br /> and ... idk.... probably some others too. </p>


    <h4>Are you available to work on my project?</h4>
    <p>Dunno! Shoot me a email using the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> form and I'll get back to you as soon as I
      can!</p>

    <h4>What sort of art do you do?</h4>
    <p>Mostly mural arts. But I am in the process of combining my propensity for technology with my love of visual arts.
      More to come! If you want to see a Augmented Reality Project I did, watch <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtpZDYSYy5s">this short documentary about it</a>. Its goofy.</p>
